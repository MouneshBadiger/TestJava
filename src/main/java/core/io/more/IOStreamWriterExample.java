/**OutputStreamWriter is a class which is used to convert character stream to byte stream, the characters are encoded into byte using a specified charset. write() method calls the encoding converter which converts the character into bytes. The resulting bytes are then accumulated in a buffer before being written into the underlying output stream. The characters passed to write() methods are not buffered. We optimize the performance of OutputStreamWriter by using it with in a BufferedWriter so that to avoid frequent converter invocation.*/
